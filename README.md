- 👋 Hi, I’m @teaouu
- 👀 I’m interested in learning different langauges and frameworks that may be leverage in developing medical software and/or tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I believe Python's wide library can also be leverage to maximize development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical projects, that may be focus in open-source data collection or processing to achieve medical diagnosis or discovery.
- 📫 You can reach me at my personal email: teaouu@gmail.com
